## Getting started
Please use the [nyt-scotus-loader](https://github.com/newsdev/nyt-scotus-loader) and [nyt-scdb-loader](https://github.com/newsdev/nyt-scdb-loader) to get previous and current term data loaded.

This project is meant to specify an admin and a read API.

## Bootstrapping
Our environment and install requirements.
```
mkvirtualenv nyt-scotus
git clone git@github.com:newsdev/nyt-scotus.git && cd nyt-scotus
pip install -r requirements.txt
add2virtualenv .
add2virtualenv scotus
add2virtualenv config
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.dev.settings
```

## The Admin
![](http://bukk.it/noidea-professor.jpg)

## The API
This assumes you're running `django-admin runserver` on `127.0.0.1:8000` which is the default setting.

### [Voting clusters](http://127.0.0.1:8000/scotus/api/v1/voting/justice/Scalia/?term=2014&justices=Alito,Thomas,Roberts&max_votes=5,6)
Voting clusters returns counts and lists of cases where the Justices specified in the API call voted on the same side, either `agree_cases` where the Justices voted together in the majority or `disagree_cases` where they voted together in the minority.

#### Requires
* A time parameter; either `term` or `naturalcourt`.
* A Justice name, e.g., `Scalia` in the URL path.
* A list of Justice names, e.g., `justices=Kennedy,Thomas,Alito` for finding common cases.

#### Optional
* A list of vote distributions to consider, expressed by the maximum vote count, e.g., `max_votes=5,6` would limit the query to just 5-4 and 6-3 decisions.

#### Output

### [Cases by Term](http://127.0.0.1:8000/scotus/api/v1/case/by-term/)
A CSV you could use to make a graphic like [this one.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/23/upshot/the-roberts-courts-surprising-move-leftward.html) Returns cases grouped by NaturalCourt and grouped by **weighted NYT majority votes**, a score which normalizes votes that do not represent all 9 Justices. Also includes *kennedy share* and *powell share* for 5-4 decisions, a useful measure of how the Court's median Justice voted.
